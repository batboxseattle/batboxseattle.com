    <h1>About Batbox</h1>
    <p>Many phrases have been used to describe Batbox over the years: “your mom’s favorite band,” “probably the best
    three-piece alt-rock/punk/indie/blues fusion featuring trumpet, violin, euphonium, ukulele, and synthesizer this side of
    The International Date Line”, and [THIRD THING HERE]. But from all of these, one thing is clear: they probably are a
    band. Since their founding in 2017, Batbox has been playing festivals and touring up and down the PNW, pissing off local
    politicians along the way. They dropped their first studio album in 2021, spitting mad rhymes about topics including
    politics, relationships, and post-post-post-modern queerness in The West. Batbox is currently accepting booking requests
    via DM, email, telepathy, inception, summoning rituals, or by yelling really really loud.</p>
