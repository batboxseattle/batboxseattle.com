                Many phrases have been used to describe Batbox over the years: “your mom’s favorite band,” “probably the
                best
                three-piece alt-rock/punk/indie/blues fusion featuring trumpet, violin, euphonium, ukulele, and synthesizer
                this
                side of
                The International Date Line”, and [THIRD THING HERE]. But from all of these, one thing is clear: they
                probably are a
                band. Since their founding in 2017, Batbox has been playing festivals and touring up and down the PNW,
                pissing off
                local
                politicians along the way.

                They dropped their first studio album in 2021, spitting mad rhymes about topics including politics,
                relationships,
                and
                post-post-post-modern queerness in The West. Batbox is currently accepting booking requests via DM, email,
                telepathy,
                inception, summoning rituals, or by yelling really really loud.
