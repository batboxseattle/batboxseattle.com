Notes from Oct 17th meeting:
Contact us page: Email is good. no EPK link public.
social media again. move it from the about page to contact page.
gallery section for non press photos this will go to a google folder
shows is only past shows, see photos will link to a google drive folder
dont like the non title font. the feeling is not there. need new font.
update a few video links more youtube on music / video page
no description for featured muisicians. keep it simple. update in future. maybe this could also be a json.
see more videos in epk should go to vidoes#
add music player to this page EPK
get in touch with us section -> make this say link to press photos, logos, etc.
Set it up so that shows can be in a JSON file.
